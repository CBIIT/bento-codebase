    - paragraph: NCI's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) charged
            the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR) to
            build the integrated Canine Data Commons (ICDC), a cloud-based repository
            of canine cancer data. ICDC was established to further research
            on human cancers by enabling comparative
            analysis with canine cancer. The data in the ICDC is sourced
            from multiple different programs and projects; all focused on
            the canine subjects.The data is harmonized into an integrated data model and then made 
            available to the research community $$[Cloud Resources](https://datascience.cancer.gov/data-commons/cloud-resources)$$
            The ICDC is part of the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC), an initiative
            from NCI’s Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT).
            Bioinformatic analysis of the ICDC data is accomplished using the CRDC’s
    - paragraph: Within the FNLCR, the Biomedical Informatics and Data Science (BIDS) Directorate is
            focused on software engineering and data handling.  The Applied and Developmental
            Research Directorate (ADRD) is managing the ICDC Steering Committee and providing
            one of the data sources for the ICDC. Finally, there is also an ICDC Steering
            Committee (composed of external members, FNLCR and NCI staff) that provides advice
            to DCTD on the ICDC.

  title: "Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) and Analysis"
  content:
    - paragraph: $$[The Cancer Research DataCommons](https://datascience.cancer.gov/data-commons)$$ is an initiative from NCI’s Center for Biomedical
        Informatics & Information Technology ( $$[CBIIT](https://datascience.cancer.gov/)$$). CBIIT’s vision for the project consists of a 
        virtual, expandable infrastructure that provides secure access to many different data types across scientific domains, 
        allowing users to analyze, share, and store results, leveraging the storage and elastic compute, or ability to easily scale resources, of the 
        cloud. The ability to combine diverse data types and perform cross-domain analysis of large data sets can lead to new discoveries in cancer prevention, 
        treatment and diagnosis, and supports the goals of precision medicine and the Cancer Moonshot℠.
    - paragraph: 'CLOUD RESOURCES:'
    - paragraph: The CRDC has three Cloud Resourcesoutbounnd web site icon options (
        $$[Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud ](http://www.cancergenomicscloud.org/)$$,$$[ISB Cancer Genomics Cloud ](https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/)$$, $$[Terra ](https://terra.bio/)$$),
        each providing analysis platforms for the community to use when working with Data Commons data.
    - paragraph: These cloud-based platforms eliminate the need for researchers to download and store extremely large data sets by allowing them to bring 
        analysis tools to the data in the cloud, instead of the traditional process of bringing the data to the tools on local hardware. The Cloud Resources 
        also provide access to on-demand computational capacity to analyze these data. The Cloud Resources allow users to run best practice tools and pipelines 
        already implemented or upload their own data or analysis methods to workspaces.
    - paragraph: All three Cloud Resources provide support for data access through a web-based user interface in addition to programmatic access to analytic 
       tools and workflows, and the capability of sharing results with collaborators. Each Cloud Resource is continually developing new functionality to improve 
       the user experience and add new tools for researchers.
    - paragraph: SEVEN BRIDGES CANCER GENOMICS CLOUD (SBG) is hosted on Amazon Web Services and has a rich user interface that allows researchers to find data of 
       interest and combine it with their own private data. Data can be analyzed using more than 200 preinstalled, curated bioinformatics tools and workflows. 
       Researchers can also extend the functionality of the platform by adding their own data and tools via an intuitive software development kit.
    - paragraph: INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY CANCER GENOMICS CLOUD (ISB-CGC) leveraging many aspects of the Google Cloud Platform, allows scientists to 
       interactively define and compare cohorts, examine underlying molecular data for specific genes and pathways, and share insights with collaborators. 
       For computational users, Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources such as BigQuery and Google Pipeline service, 
       allow complex queries from R or Python scripts, or Dockerized workflows to run on data available in the Google Cloud Storage.
    - paragraph: BROAD INSTITUTE TERRA is an open, standards-based platform for performing production-scale data analysis in the cloud. Built on the Google 
       Cloud Platform, Terra empowers analysts, tool developers, and production managers to run large-scale analysis and to share results with collaborators. 
       Users can upload their own analysis methods and data to workspaces or run the Broad’s best practice tools and pipelines.
