            the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR) to
            build the integrated Canine Data Commons (ICDC), a cloud-based repository
            of canine cancer data. ICDC was established to further research
            on human cancers by enabling comparative
            analysis with canine cancer. The data in the ICDC is sourced
            from multiple different programs and projects; all focused on
            the canine subjects.The data is harmonized into an integrated data model and then made 
            available to the research community **[Cloud Resources](https://datascience.cancer.gov/data-commons/cloud-resources)**
            The ICDC is part of the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC), an initiative
            from NCI’s Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT).
            Bioinformatic analysis of the ICDC data is accomplished using the CRDC’s
    - paragraph: Within the FNLCR, the Biomedical Informatics and Data Science (BIDS) Directorate is
            focused on software engineering and data handling.  The Applied and Developmental
            Research Directorate (ADRD) is managing the ICDC Steering Committee and providing
            one of the data sources for the ICDC. Finally, there is also an ICDC Steering
            Committee (composed of external members, FNLCR and NCI staff) that provides advice
            to DCTD on the ICDC.
